# [CHARITY XI](https://firstnamejonas.github.io/charity-xi)

When you think of CharityXI, think about the best football match ever, with the biggest stars on the planet, where all your family and friends can take part and all the money is donated to good causes!

This website is designed to give ticket buyers all the information they need to encourage them to buy tickets and find out more about the project. Visitors to the website will be able to find out which causes are being donated to, the venue of the event, which players are taking part and when tickets will be on sale. The goal of the website is to have a newsletter form at the end of the website, which informs customers when tickets will be sold.

## UX

User Experience (UX) plays a crucial role in shaping and implementing the CharityXI website. My aim is not only give out information about the charity project but also to create an engaging and user-friendly environment that inspires visitors to actively participate in the project.
My UX design process has been carefully crafted to ensure that users navigate seamlessly through the website, understand the mission of CharityXI, and ultimately feel motivated to purchase tickets and sign up for the presale. 

The process includes:		
- Understanding what the costumer want to be informed about to get interested, this forms the foundation for a design that strategically caters to the interests of the visitors.
- I’ve structured the website to make information intuitively accessible. This involves clear navigation paths to ensure visitors effortlessly move through the various sections of the website.
- The visual appearance has been designed to be easy to understand the key messages and mission behind CharityXI and get informations quick, as well as ticket access

### Colour Scheme

- `white` used for primary text.
- `#050A30` used for primary background color

I used those colors, because this oxford blue stands for trust and the white stands in very good contrast to that.

### Typography

- Arial, with a backfall font of sans-serif, was used for all text on the page.
